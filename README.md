# Backend (Node.js)

A **general-purpose Node.js backend repository** for learning, experimenting, and building backend concepts step by step. This repository is **not tied to a single project**—it acts as a common workspace for multiple backend experiments, mini-projects, and practice modules.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Learn **Node.js fundamentals**
* Practice **modules, scripts, and folder structuring**
* Experiment with **npm packages** (like figlet, utilities, etc.)
* Maintain **clean Git practices** for backend development

This repo will **grow over time** as more backend concepts are added.

## 📁 General Project Structure

```
Backend/
├─ NodeJs/
│  ├─ FigletDir/        # npm package experiments (e.g. figlet)
│  ├─ Fruit/            # module import/export practice
│  ├─ myProject/        # individual backend mini-projects
│  ├─ Math.js           # utility scripts
│  └─ Script.js         # Node.js basics & experiments
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```

> Each folder inside `NodeJs/` may represent **a separate concept or mini-project**.

## 🚀 Getting Started (General)

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (LTS recommended)
* **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Install Dependencies (per project)

Each sub-folder can have its own dependencies:

```bash
cd NodeJs/<project-folder>
npm install
```

Run files using:

```bash
node index.js
```

(or any entry file inside that folder)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered (Growing List)

* Node.js runtime basics
* CommonJS modules (`require` / `module.exports`)
* npm & package management
* Using third‑party packages
* File & folder organization
* CLI scripts

---

## 🛡️ Git Best Practices

* `node_modules/` is **ignored globally**
* `.env` files are **never committed**
* Only source code and configuration files are tracked

```gitignore
node_modules/
.env
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* This repository is **for learning and experimentation**
* Code quality and structure may improve as skills grow
* Older folders may contain beginner-level examples
